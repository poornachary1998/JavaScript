# JavaScript Interview Preparation ðŸš€

This repository is a **complete roadmap** to master JavaScript for **interviews (MAANG / Product-based companies)**.  
It covers **Beginner â†’ Intermediate â†’ Advanced** concepts with theory, coding exercises, and polyfills.  

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner (Foundations â€” must be crystal clear)
These are basics, but interviewers expect you to explain them deeply.

1. Variables & Data Types (var, let, const, typeof, primitive vs reference types)  - Done
2. Type Conversion & Coercion  - Done
3. Operators (== vs ===, logical operators, ternary, spread/rest)  
4. Control Structures (if, switch, loops, forâ€¦in, forâ€¦of)  
5. Functions Basics (declaration, expression, arrow functions)  
6. Scope & Lexical Environment  
7. Hoisting  
8. Closures  
9. The `this` keyword (global, object, function, arrow fn, bind/apply/call)  
10. Prototype & Inheritance  
11. Objects & Arrays Basics (create, iterate, destructure, freeze, seal)  
12. ES6 Basics â†’ let/const, template literals, default params, destructuring, spread/rest  

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (Where real interviews begin)
Here youâ€™ll start building **polyfills, async code, and DOM stuff**.

13. Execution Context & Call Stack  
14. Event Loop, Microtask Queue, Macrotask Queue  
15. Timers (setTimeout, setInterval, requestAnimationFrame)  
16. Call/Apply/Bind  
17. Currying  
18. Polyfills (forEach, map, filter, reduce, bind, call, apply)  
19. Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy (JSON, structuredClone, recursion)  
20. Event Bubbling, Capturing & Delegation  
21. Promises (then, catch, finally)  
22. Async/Await  
23. Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.allSettled  
24. Error Handling (try/catch, async errors)  
25. Modules & Imports/Exports (ESM vs CommonJS)  
26. Generators & Iterators  
27. Set, Map, WeakSet, WeakMap  
28. Symbol & BigInt  
29. LocalStorage, SessionStorage, Cookies  
30. Debounce & Throttle (implement)  
31. Memoization (implement)  
32. JavaScript Engine & Garbage Collection  

---

## ðŸ”´ Advanced (MAANG-level, tough interview Qs)
Now youâ€™re getting into **design patterns, optimizations, and internals**.

33. Custom Polyfills â†’ debounce, throttle, once, compose, pipe, flatten array, deepClone  
34. Custom Implementation â†’ Promise, Promise.all, async/await, call/apply/bind, EventEmitter  
35. Event Loop Deep Dive â†’ Node.js vs Browser  
36. Shadow DOM, Custom Elements, Web Components  
37. Service Workers & Caching  
38. WebSockets & Server-Sent Events (SSE)  
39. JavaScript Patterns (singleton, factory, observer, module, publish-subscribe, prototype)  
40. Functional Programming Concepts (pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions)  
41. OOP in JS (classes, constructor, private fields, static methods)  
42. Memory Management & Leaks  
43. Performance Optimization (reflow vs repaint, requestIdleCallback, web workers)  
44. Security in JS (XSS, CSRF basics, sanitization)  
45. Event Loop Advanced (task vs microtask vs rendering pipeline)  
46. Front-End System Design with JS (SPA routing, lazy loading, bundling, module federation)

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use This Repo
- Pick **1 concept per day** (2â€“3 hrs deep dive).  
- **Learn â†’ Code â†’ Push to GitHub â†’ Write short notes**.  
- Maintain consistency: **daily commits = daily progress**.  
- Revise weekly and connect concepts with **React + System Design**.  

---

ðŸ’¡ By following this roadmap for **2 months**, youâ€™ll have:  
- âœ… A strong grasp of JavaScript (beginner â†’ advanced)  
- âœ… A GitHub repo full of polyfills, examples, and mini-projects  
- âœ… Confidence for **DSA + Frontend interviews at 25 LPA+ companies**
